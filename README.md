## Concept
2020 Reimagined is a place where users can browse the awesome events that happened in 2020 in an imaginary world where there was never a pandemic.

In an alternate reality, thousands of people attended events across the world in 2020 living their best lives. Users can let us know what their 2020 selves thought as they partied, supported and travelled to these incredible events.
