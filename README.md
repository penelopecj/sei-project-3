## Concept
2020 Reimagined is a place where users can browse the awesome events that happened in 2020 in an imaginary world where there was never a pandemic.

In an alternate reality, thousands of people attended events across the world in 2020 living their best lives. Users can let us know what their 2020 selves thought as they partied, celebrated, and travelled to these incredible events.

## Project Brief
* Build our most advanced project to date with achievable scope and a focus on creating a professional finished product.
* Make it a full-stack application by making our own backend and frontend.
* Use an Express API to serve our data from a Mongo database.
* Consume our API with a separate frontend built with React.
* Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for multiple models.
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes for MVP and additional features.
* Have a visually impressive design.
